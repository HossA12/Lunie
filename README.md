## Lunie — Ambient Daily Moon Info (cool + interactive)
Lunie is a small desktop app that shows today’s moon phase and details in a calm, ambient UI. It renders a shaded moon disc, follows your cursor with a subtle parallax effect, and blinks occasionally for a cozy, living feel. It’s designed to sit on your screen like a little night companion.

Daily info: date, phase name, illumination %, and age (days)
Physically-inspired phase shading based on CSV data
Smooth parallax motion + blink animation
Dark, minimal theme (CustomTkinter)
Optional background music (auto-plays if a track is present)
Windows: auto-creates a Desktop shortcut on first run
